This project is a simple IC Tester to test type of 4 types of ICs and also check if the IC is fully working or it have a corrupted gate inside it
ICs under test are: 
* 7411: Triple 3-input AND gate IC
* 7486: Quad 2-input XOR gate IC
* 7408: Quad 2-input AND gate IC
* 7432: Quad 2-input OR gate IC
* 7400: Quad 2-input NAND gate IC
* 7404: Hex NOT gate IC
