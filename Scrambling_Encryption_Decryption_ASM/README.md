Scrambling encryption-decryption system: Using x86 Assembly language and EMU8086 Emulator Tool. It's a program to encrypt input message using scrambling encryption, and decrypt it to obtain the original text message. The scrambling encryption algorithm determines the position of the character in the message in binary, and computes the new character's position by reversing its original position in binary.
